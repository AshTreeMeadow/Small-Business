# Small Business Website Project

## 📖 Project Overview
This is a beginner-level **static website** project designed to simulate a small business online presence. The goal of this project was to practice the fundamentals of HTML structure, file navigation, and basic styling.

It consists of four interlinked HTML pages representing a standard business layout.

## 📂 File Structure
The project contains the following files:

* **Home Page.html**: The main landing page. It lists the services provided and links to all other sections.
* **About Us.html**: A page dedicated to company history and values.
* **Contact Us.html**: Displays contact information including email (`example@yahoo.com`), phone, and address.
* **Career.html**: A listing of current job opportunities.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used
### 1. HTML5 Structure
* Used the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to ensure standards mode.
* Organized content using Semantic tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<div>`).

### 2. Navigation (Linking)
* Used the anchor tag `<a>` with the `href` attribute to connect pages.
* Example: `<a href="About Us.html">About Us</a>` allows the user to jump from the Home page to the About page.

### 3. Inline CSS Styling
Instead of an external stylesheet, this project uses **inline styles** to learn how CSS properties affect elements directly.
* **Background Colors:** distinct colors were used to differentiate pages (e.g., `sandybrown` for Home/About and `bisque` for Career/Contact).
* **Text Alignment:** Used `style="text-align: center;"` to center headers and navigation links.
* **List Styling:** Used `list-style-position: inside;` to control the bullet point alignment for the Services and Jobs lists.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Locate the folder on your computer.
3.  Double-click `Home Page.html` to open it in your default web browser.
4.  Click the navigation links at the bottom of the page to browse the site.

## 📝 Future Improvements
To advance this project in the future, the following features could be added:
* **External CSS:** Move the `style="..."` attributes into a separate `.css` file for cleaner code.
* **Forms:** Add an actual `<form>` tag to the "Contact Us" page so users can send messages.
* **Images:** Add a logo or banner image using the `<img>` tag.
